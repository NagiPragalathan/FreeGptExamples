# FreeGPT Examples

This repository provides examples for using the FreeGPT module, a lightweight Python library for integrating GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) capabilities into various applications. These examples demonstrate how to leverage FreeGPT for a range of tasks including natural language understanding, text generation, and more.

## Overview

The FreeGPT Examples repository contains a collection of scripts and projects that illustrate how to utilize the FreeGPT module. Whether you are building chatbots, content generators, or any other application that benefits from GPT-3's powerful language model, these examples will help you get started quickly.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts.
- **Chatbot Development**: Create conversational agents that can understand and respond to user inputs.
- **Content Creation**: Automatically generate articles, blog posts, and other forms of content.
- **Language Translation**: Translate text from one language to another using GPT's capabilities.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of a given text input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python Package Installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/NagiPragalathan/FreeGptExamples.git
    cd FreeGptExamples` 
    
2. Install dependencies:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
    

### Usage

Each example is contained within its own directory. Navigate to the directory of the example you wish to run and follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.

For example, to run the text generation example:

1. Navigate to the text generation example directory:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd text-generation` 
    
2. Run the example script:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `python generate_text.py` 
    

## Examples

### 1\. Text Generation

This example demonstrates how to use FreeGPT to generate text based on an input prompt. The script takes a prompt from the user and generates a continuation of the text using the GPT model.

### 2\. Chatbot

In this example, a simple chatbot is created using FreeGPT. The chatbot can understand and respond to user inputs in a conversational manner.

### 3\. Content Creation

This example shows how to use FreeGPT for content creation. The script generates a blog post based on a given topic.

### 4\. Language Translation

This example demonstrates how to translate text from one language to another using the FreeGPT module.

### 5\. Sentiment Analysis

This example shows how to analyze the sentiment of a given text input, determining whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral.
